# Pill Pic 💊

Pill Pic is a deep learning, image-recognition model that predicts pills by simply snapping a picture 📸 with your phone camera. 

By combining the power of Yolov8 for image detection and Google's Inception v3 for image recognition, Pill Pic is able to identify Candadian medication and relay important and relevant information back to the user. 

Infomation such as: warnings and precautions ⚠️, ingredients 🥕, contraindications, what to do in the event of an overdosage, compatibility with pregnancy or nursing 🍼, etc.
